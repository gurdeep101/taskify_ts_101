* create new app; initialises new app with dependencies
    npx create-react-app taskify-ts --template typescript
npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd taskify-ts
  npm start

* remove files not needed
    app.test.tsx; logo.svg; reportWebVitals.ts;setupTests.ts;
* remove references to files deleted
* remove default styles from app.css - moves hello world from left to center

what is TS? - strict type checking
* in JS types are inferred; don't need to be declared
* in TS need to be declared using ":" e.g. let name: string = 'Gurdeep'
* this gives error when string variable assigned to number
